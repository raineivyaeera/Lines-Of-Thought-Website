        <h4>May 19th, 2023</h4>
        <p id="blog-p">In the past few months I've redone my website 2 times in major ways. Going with a dark style with purple and red, and then going with a black and crimson-ish red style - having the blog part being the forefront. And while I did find some success in both and learned from them, I didn't like them very much. I mean sure they worked and functioned but running them through a test it failed miserably. That test? The 13 year old me.</p>
        <p id="blog-p">When I was 12 to 13, I was dipping my feet into many new areas. Game development with Unity + C#, playing guitar seriously dedicating several hours a day to it, digital art, and making & recording music. Having no idea what the hell to do or where to begin with these domains, I used Youtube like a bible. Practicing and learning everyday, picking up something new or interesting to add to my nifty toolbelt. My point of bringing this up though is that me in the past - if you really think about it with yourself too - is the ideal market to aim for. At the time, I wanted nothing more than to learn all about music, theory, game development, and later on more complex issues through exploring those trails. Some of those trails being creative heuristic exploration, sound design, audio programming, living a more focused life with personal fullfillment not other people's idea of fullfillment.</p>
        <p id="blog-p">So I realized after remaking my website several times I wanted to look back to my previous self and make a website they would actively want to discover and explore. What I came back with is a versatile and well written - atleast for my standards - design made by hand that scales across mobile & web in 720p, 1080p, and 4k, with a pleasing clearly segmented layout.</p>
        <p id="blog-p">Immediantly starting with a warm welcome and an expressive but simple condensing of what it is I do. Next section being my 3 areas of navigation for the site: Blog, Tools, & Portfolio. Blog, of course, being my blog. This is where I'll post my finding and paths for the day. What I learned, what I spent time on, and the creations I made. Tools section is about the resources and things I develop. Whether it be synth patches, instruments, applications, field recordings, or whatever it is my weird brain comes up with that could be of value to someone else. Again, keeping in mind my previous 13 year old self. Portfolio is where I will put my best work in each area of Music, Art, & Programming. The next segment would be a clear place for all my links that I currently opperate under such as my Bandcamp, Itchio, Youtube, Newgrounds, and Ko-Fi page. Still just adore the color selection and how it pops out without being an assult to the eyes. Finally, the last segment is one I wish more people put on their sites...A message me section. 13 year old me would've killed to talk to someone in my areas and knowledge nowadays. It would have changed my completely and so I want to offer that for other people. Giving them not only my email, but my personal discord that I check very often. People seeing your work give a shit, so give a shit about them back. Be an inspiration like how people on youtube, articles, & books were for you.</p>
        <p id="blog-p">Overall, I'm very proud of this and I know for a fact that my younger self would've been impressed and captured by it, feeling less alone in the world. I still have the tools and portfolio section to implement but until then thank you so much for reading, I hope you found this to be inspiring, and for the first time, Godspeed to you :)</p>
