            <p> Since 2 and a half weeks ago I've acomplished quite a lot it's hard to dig in! For starters, I composed the soundtrack to a small game jam game with my dear friend Kathinka! Did a nice piano song with a glitched variant for it, but that's not all!!! I also did sound effects for the first time on a project! Can't word to you how much fun that was and how fulfilling it was as work. Took about 2 or 3 hours I believe and just had a blast. Recording a shoe hitting my blanket, peanuts being cracked open, and doors being opened...You can tell how much fun I had. if you would like to listen to the project, here you go :) </p>

            <p> Sometimes productivity can't be measured in normal metrics and it's definitely been one of those kinda periods. But holy shit did I do a massive amount in terms of meeting people. I added it up, I met <b>80 people. In 30 days.</b> Which, I don't know about you, IS CRAZY. I don't even know how I did it...Well that's a lie! How I did it was making meeting people a daily habbit. Everyday, no matter what, meeting one new person. Often doing more than just 1 - because I got in the zone - and that's how that happened! 80 people, a few of them being absolute gold and people I want in my life for the rest of my existence on earth. OH, and that brings me to another point!</p>
            <p> One of those people, particularly that I resonate with on an emotional level in terms of our personality and ADHD, showed me what Witchcraft actually is. I...Was honestly just stunned over how many similarities I shared with witches and how different the meaning of actually being a witch is. Bringing magic into the mundane, meditation, channeling energy, perspective shifts, manifesting, being one with the pulse of life, etc. It's a very varied and magical practice full of differences and beauties. Not what the mainstream connotation paints at all, oh my goodness. Proudly a Secular Eclectic Witch âœ¨ </p>
            <p> Been getting back into Blender recently and Krita abstract art, having fun n doin stuff! One project oddly left me to creating a futuristic instrument that I had no idea would sound like so I made it. At the end of the day, it took me 5 hours, and I proudly released it on itchio for free. Very cool sounding instrument and I think yall will have fun with it. Give it a try below :D </p>

            <p> That's about all for right now but this website is only just starting and I'll be implementing the namesake in a more apparent way hehe. Have fun, and godspeed :) </p>
